                    SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP TESTING GUIDE
                    What to Do Right Now
================================================================================

YOU HAVE XV6 RUNNING! Here's exactly what to do:

================================================================================
STEP 1: Test in Your Current xv6 Window
================================================================================

In the xv6 terminal that's already running, type these commands:

1. Type: pals_int
   Press ENTER
   WAIT for it to finish (will take 30-60 seconds with new workload)
   
2. Type: pals_aging  
   Press ENTER
   WAIT for it to finish (will take 1-2 minutes)
   
3. Type: pals_cmp
   Press ENTER
   WAIT for it to finish (will take 1-2 minutes)

4. Exit xv6:
   Press: Ctrl-A
   Then press: x

COPY ALL THE OUTPUT - you'll need it for comparison!

================================================================================
STEP 2: Build PALS Version
================================================================================

In your terminal (after exiting xv6):

$ make clean
$ CFLAGS=-DPALS make
$ make qemu

Wait for xv6 to boot...

================================================================================
STEP 3: Run Same Tests with PALS
================================================================================

In the new xv6 window, run THE SAME commands:

$ pals_int
$ pals_aging
$ pals_cmp

Exit: Ctrl-A then x

COPY THIS OUTPUT TOO!

================================================================================
STEP 4: What to Compare
================================================================================

Compare these metrics between baseline and PALS:

From pals_int:
--------------
Baseline: Look at "wakeup-to-work latency" values
PALS:     Should show LOWER latency values

Example:
  Baseline: latency 5, 12, 8, 15, 20 ticks (high variance)
  PALS:     latency 3, 4, 5, 4, 6 ticks (low variance)


From pals_aging:
----------------
Baseline: Look at when LOW-PRIORITY processes finish
PALS:     Should finish SOONER (less starvation)

Example:
  Baseline: Dominant finishes at 500, Low-priority at 8000 (16x slower)
  PALS:     Dominant finishes at 500, Low-priority at 3000 (6x slower)


From pals_cmp:
--------------
Baseline: Look at "Avg wakeup latency" for I/O-BOUND processes
PALS:     Should show LOWER average latency

Example:
  Baseline: Avg wakeup latency 15 ticks
  PALS:     Avg wakeup latency 8 ticks

================================================================================
QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

1. ✓ You already have xv6 running (baseline)
2. Run: pals_int, pals_aging, pals_cmp
3. Save the output
4. Exit (Ctrl-A then x)
5. Build PALS: make clean && CFLAGS=-DPALS make && make qemu
6. Run same 3 tests
7. Compare the numbers!

PALS should show:
  ✓ Lower wakeup latency
  ✓ Less starvation (bounded wait times)
  ✓ Better I/O responsiveness
